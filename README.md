# Sudoku-Solver

This Python program solves Sudoku puzzles of various difficulties using variations of the AC-3 constraint satisfaction algorithm. 

In order to run this program:
1) Download both Python files as well as the puzzle text files.
2) Save them in the same directory.
3) In either a terminal or Python IDE, run `sudoku_main.py`. This will prompt you to enter a puzzle you would like to be solved. (Note: you are limited to the .txt files included in this repository)
4) When you run the program on a proper .txt file, a text file named `solution.txt` will be created in the directory, in which you can view the solution. 
5) To exit the program, enter 'quit'.
